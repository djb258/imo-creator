# archive/

**Purpose**: Superseded doctrine files preserved for reference.

Files in this directory were moved here during the CTB Hardening v2.0.0 consolidation. They are **not authoritative** and should not be referenced for current doctrine.

## Contents

| File | Original Location | Superseded By |

## Why Archived

During CTB Hardening v2.0.0, three separate architecture documents were consolidated into a single `ARCHITECTURE.md`. The originals were archived here, and redirect stubs were left in `templates/doctrine/` for backward compatibility.

## Current Doctrine

All architecture doctrine now lives in `templates/doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` (v2.1.0).
