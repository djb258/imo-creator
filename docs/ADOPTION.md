## Required Lifecycle (In Order)

Downstream repositories MUST progress through the following phases in order.
No phase may be skipped.

### 1. Constitutional Admission

Adopt governance and enforcement.

- Read `CONSTITUTION.md`
- Read `IMO_CONTROL.json`
- Execute `APPLY_DOCTRINE.prompt.md`

**Result:** Repo is legally governed.

---

### 2. Structural Instantiation

Declare structure and identity.

- Execute `DECLARE_STRUCTURE_AND_RENDER_TREE.prompt.md`
- Declare hubs, sub-hubs, spokes
- Mint unique IDs (hub, sub-hub, spoke, process)
- Normalize repository structure to CTB

**Result:** Repo matches doctrine shape.

---

### 3. Data Declaration (If Applicable)

Declare AI-ready data schemas.

- Execute `DECLARE_DATA_AND_RENDER_ERD.prompt.md`
- Define tables, columns, relationships
- Generate ERD artifacts

**Result:** Data layer is machine-readable and auditable.

---

### 4. Execution Wiring

Bind declared processes to executable intent.

- Execute `DECLARE_EXECUTION_WIRING.prompt.md`
- Define triggers, schedules, kill switches, observability

**Result:** System is runnable by humans or agents.

---

## Scope Boundary

IMO-Creator governs:

- Structure
- Declaration
- Identity
- Documentation
- Wiring intent

IMO-Creator does NOT provide:

- Runtime execution
- Job history
- State mutation
- Scheduling engines

Those belong to downstream systems.

---

## Enforcement Rule

Governor first. Subject second.
Structure before logic.
If uncertain: STOP and ASK.
