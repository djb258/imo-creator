# MCP Doctrine Layer - HEIR/ORBT Enforcement Framework

**Branch:** `mcp-doctrine-layer`  
**Classification:** System-Critical Infrastructure  
**Compliance:** HEIR Doctrine v2.1 | ORBT Policy Framework  

## Overview

The MCP Doctrine Layer is the authoritative framework that governs all MCP tool interactions within the IMO-Creator ecosystem. This layer enforces structural integrity, version control, and compliance tracking across all subhives and agent interactions.

## Core Doctrine Principles

### 1. Mandatory Field Enforcement
Every MCP tool invocation MUST include:
- `unique_id`: HEIR-compliant identifier 
- `process_id`: ORBT process tracking ID
- `orbt_layer`: Policy enforcement layer designation
- `blueprint_version`: Versioned blueprint hash

### 2. Structural Integrity
- All tool manifests follow standardized JSON schema
- Payload validation occurs before tool execution
- Fallback mechanisms trigger on validation failures

### 3. Audit Trail Compliance
- Comprehensive logging via Mantis schema
- Process lineage tracking through ORBT layers
- Kill-switch capabilities for emergency containment

## Implementation Requirements

### Pre-Tool Execution Checklist
- [ ] Unique ID generated and validated
- [ ] Process ID linked to parent blueprint
- [ ] ORBT layer permissions verified
- [ ] Tool manifest schema validated
- [ ] Logging pipeline initialized
- [ ] Fallback handlers registered

### Post-Tool Execution Audit
- [ ] Result payload structured-logged
- [ ] Process completion status recorded
- [ ] ORBT policy compliance verified
- [ ] Blueprint version consistency maintained

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Schema Validation
All tool calls undergo mandatory schema validation against registered manifests.

### Kill Switch Protocol
Emergency containment via `trigger_orbt_repair.json` when violations detected.

### Mantis Integration
Structured logging ensures full audit trail for compliance verification.

## Usage

This layer operates as middleware between Claude Code and all MCP tool invocations. Violations result in tool call rejection and automatic ORBT repair trigger.

## Compliance Status

- **HEIR Doctrine:** ✅ Fully Compliant
- **ORBT Policy:** ✅ Enforced
- **Mantis Logging:** ✅ Integrated
- **Kill Switch:** ✅ Armed
